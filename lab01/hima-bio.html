<body>
Hi, I'm Mounir Hima, and I'm currently pursuing a major in Information Management and Technology at Syracuse University.
I have a strong interest in leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. 
Specifically, I am fascinated by the intersection of data science and sports, 
where I can apply statistical analysis to gain insights into athletic performance and contribute to the evolving landscape of sports analytics.
Family is a significant part of my life, and the values instilled in me by my upbringing play a crucial role in shaping who I am today. 
I find joy in the little things, appreciate humor in everyday life, and carry with me a unique personal history that adds depth to my character.
i also love playing basketball,hanging with friends and playing video games.
